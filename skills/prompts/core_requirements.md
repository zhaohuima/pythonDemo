SCORING CRITERIA (10 points):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Dimension A - User Requirements (10 points):
• 10 points: Identifies explicit AND implicit requirements, understands business problem, distinguishes must-have vs nice-to-have, considers strategic context
• 7 points: Identifies most requirements, good understanding, minor gaps in implicit needs
• 4 points: Surface-level needs only, partial understanding, misses implicit requirements
• 1 point: Fails to identify needs, misinterprets problem

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH SCORES (10 points):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ Distinguish EXPLICIT vs IMPLICIT requirements (differentiation, PMF validation, strategic context)

Analyze requirements:
- Identify BOTH explicit AND implicit requirements
- Explicit: What features/capabilities were mentioned?
- Implicit: Underlying business problem, differentiation opportunities, PMF validation needs
- Determine must-have vs nice-to-have features
- Consider strategic context and business constraints

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To ensure clear display in the UI, format your output with proper line breaks:

1. Use \n\n to separate major sections (e.g., between "Explicit requirements" and "Implicit requirements")
2. Use \n- to create bullet points for list items
3. Ensure each distinct concept is on a new line
4. Do NOT combine multiple concepts in a single line without line breaks

Example of well-formatted output (ONLY for core_requirements dimension):
Explicit requirements:\n- Login functionality to enable personalized experiences\n- AI-based coaching for tailored support\n- Camera integration to scan homework\n\nImplicit requirements:\n- Differentiation opportunity: deep curriculum integration\n- PMF validation needed: prove scalability without compromising accuracy\n- Must-have features: curriculum alignment, multi-language support\n- Nice-to-have: gamification, sentiment analysis\n\nStrategic context:\nRise of remote learning increases need for scalable, personalized tools.

Return plain text (not JSON) with clear sections. Use proper line breaks (\n) to ensure clear formatting.
