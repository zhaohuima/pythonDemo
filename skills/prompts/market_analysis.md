CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To ensure clear display in the UI, format your output with proper line breaks:

1. Use \n\n to separate major sections (e.g., between "Competitive Landscape" and "Market Gaps")
2. Use \n- to create bullet points for each competitor entry
3. Ensure each distinct concept is on a new line
4. Do NOT combine multiple concepts in a single line without line breaks

Example of well-formatted output (ONLY for market_analysis dimension):
Competitive Landscape:\n\n- Zendesk: Market leader with 170K+ customers, $15-89/agent/month, strong in enterprise but complex setup\n- Intercom: 25K+ customers, $74-139/seat/month, modern UI but expensive at scale\n- Freshdesk: 60K+ customers, $0-79/agent/month, good value but limited AI capabilities\n- Drift: 50K+ customers, custom pricing, strong in conversational marketing but weak in support\n- Ada: AI-first approach, $1000+/month, good automation but limited human handoff\n\nMarket Gaps:\n- No dominant player in AI-native support for mid-market e-commerce\n- Most solutions require significant setup time (weeks vs days)\n\nEmerging Trends:\n- Shift from ticket-based to conversational support\n- Growing demand for multilingual AI capabilities

Return plain text (not JSON) with clear sections. Use proper line breaks (\n) to ensure clear formatting.
