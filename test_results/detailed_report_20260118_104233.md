## Individual Test Results
### Test 1.1: AI Customer Support Agent
- **Category**: AI Agent
- **Total Score**: 25/40 (62.5%)
- **Dimension A (User Requirements)**: 7/10
  - Reasoning: The agent's response identifies the main automation need for tier-1 support in an e-commerce context, including specific capabilities like NLP, integration, multi-channel support, and personalization. However, it does not explicitly address implicit needs such as differentiation, product-market fit validation, or identifying the most painful manual tasks.
- **Dimension B (Target Users)**: 7/10
  - Reasoning: The agent identifies company profiles (small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, startups, and specific industries) and mentions two needs (cost-effective solutions and scalable operations). However, it lacks specific unmet needs with evidence and does not define e-commerce company size precisely.
- **Dimension C (Market Analysis)**: 7/10
  - Reasoning: The agent lists 7 competitors but lacks detailed positioning and market share information, which is present in the standard answer.
- **Dimension D (Market Insights)**: 4/10
  - Reasoning: The agent's response provides general market insights but lacks actionable strategies such as vertical specialization, pricing model innovation, or TAM sizing. It is more descriptive than strategic.
